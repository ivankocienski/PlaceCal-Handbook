The Team
========

PlaceCal is currently run by Geeks for Social Change, a social
enterprise formed by Dr Kim Foale to create community-led technical and
social interventions.

PlaceCal is developed by Geeks for Social Change and PHASE@MMU. It was
initially funded by Smart City accelerator CityVerve, with additional
support from Manchester City Council.

Weâ€™re working towards co-operative status and the creation of a PlaceCal
foundation: watch this space!
