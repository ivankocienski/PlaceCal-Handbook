# What is PlaceCal?

PlaceCal is both a software tool and a partnership of community organisations, charities, social housing providers, government services, health providers, and citizens. We're working together to create really great neighbourhood information sources that enable community wellness and active citizenship.

We provide a holistic social and technical toolkit designed to to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community information. This helps to make smarter, more resilient and better connected neighbourhoods that work better for everyone: especially people who are currently digitally excluded.

Our tools can be used by everyone: from older people to social prescribers like doctors and library assistants. It's all maintained and kept up-to-date by local experts: people in your community that know the area inside out.

We're especially designed to help people find small local groups right near them that organise regular events that can be really hard to discover. These events might be coffee mornings, sewing groups, computer classes or gardening groups: and are often run by organisations that have little or no budget or staff time for promotion.
