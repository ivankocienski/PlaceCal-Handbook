Creating a new calendar
-----------------------

Firstly, let’s create a new calendar for all your Public events. This
makes it really clear which events are going through to PlaceCal.

Go to the “+” symbol on the left hand side of the screen.

Click on “New calendar”

   Click on “New Calendar”

Give your calendar a name and a description if you like. Check the
timezone is correct (London).

Click the back arrow in the top left to go back.

Now you can add events to your calendar. Click in the calendar grid
roughly where your event is – don’t worry if it’s a bit off, you can
change this later.

Make sure that the event is being created on the right calendar.

Once it’s created, click the pencil to edit the event information.

If your event calendar covers multiple venues, add the venue. Be sure to
use the autocompete to set the location: having the name correctly here
helps PlaceCal make sure the event goes on the correct pages.

If your calendar is entirely for one venue, you can either skip this
step or use it to store a room number.

When this is done correctly, it will show up in the Location bar with a
postcode.

If appropriate, add in details about how often the event repeats.

Add a description – the more detailed the better. Descriptions support
`Markdown syntax <https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet>`__ if
you’re comfortable using that. Links will automatically be converted
into clickable links inside PlaceCal.

Your event listing is complete!

Repeat this process for your other public events.

Sharing your calendar link with PlaceCal
----------------------------------------

Your calendar is now up and running and can be updated either with a
desktop browser, or using the Google Calendar phone or tablet app. Now
you need to share this information with us so we can import it into the
site.

Go back to the main screen, click on the three vertical dots next to
your calendar name, and click “Settings and sharing”

Select “Make available to public”.

This will bring up a warning – this is fine and is just warning you this
information will now be public.

Scroll to the “Integrate calendar setting”. Copy the “Public address in
iCal format” field and email it to support@placecal.org.
