## Creating a new calendar

Firstly, let's create a new calendar for all your Public events. This makes it really clear which events are going through to PlaceCal.

Go to the "+" symbol on the left hand side of the screen.

Give your calendar a name and a description if you like. Check the timezone is correct (London).

2. Add support@placecal.org as an admin and make sure to click "make changes to events and manage sharing"
