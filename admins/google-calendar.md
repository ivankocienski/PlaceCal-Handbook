## Creating a new calendar

Firstly, let's create a new calendar for all your Public events. This makes it really clear which events are going through to PlaceCal.

Go to the "+" symbol on the left hand side of the screen.

Click on "New calendar"

Give your calendar a name and a description if you like. Check the timezone is correct (London).

Click the back arrow in the top left to go back.

Now you can add events to your calendar. Click in the calendar grid roughly where your event is -- don't worry if it's a bit off, you can change this later.

Make sure that the event is being created on the right calendar.

Once it's created, click the pencil to edit the event information.

If your event calendar covers multiple venues, add the venue. Be sure to use the autocompete to set the location: having the name correctly here helps PlaceCal make sure the event goes on the correct pages.
