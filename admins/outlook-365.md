## Creating a new calendar

Firstly, let's create a new calendar for all your Public events. This makes it really clear which events are going through to PlaceCal.

Click "Add calendar" then "Secondary calendar".

This will bring in a little box in the left sidebar to type the name of your calendar in. This is a little hidden!
