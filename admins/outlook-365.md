# Outlook 365

## Creating a new calendar

Firstly, let’s create a new calendar for all your Public events. This
makes it really clear which events are going through to PlaceCal.

Click “Add calendar” then “Secondary calendar”.

This will bring in a little box in the left sidebar to type the name of
your calendar in. This is a little hidden!

![Add your calendar name](/assets/outlook-calendar/02.png "Add your calendar name")

Now you can add events to your calendar. Click on “New” and then
“Calendar event”. Give your event a name.

![New event](/assets/outlook-calendar/03.png "New event")

If your event calendar covers multiple venues, add the venue. Be sure to
use the autocompete to set the location: having the name correctly here
helps PlaceCal make sure the event goes on the correct pages.

If your calendar is entirely for one venue, you can either skip this
step or use it to store a room number.

Add relevant information about how often this event is, if needed.

![Repeating events settings](/assets/outlook-calendar/05.png "Repeating events settings")

Make sure that the calendar is set to the new calendar you just created,
and not the default one in Outlook.

Consider turning off Reminders if you use Outlook a lot. If this is the
only thing you use it for it might not matter.

![Disable reminders](/assets/outlook-calendar/07.png "Disable reminders")

Add a Description and check everything looks OK. When you’re ready,
click “Save”.

![Check event](/assets/outlook-calendar/08.png "Check event")

Great! You’ve added your event and it should show up. Repeat this for
your other events.

## Sharing your calendar link with PlaceCal

To get your events on PlaceCal we need to go through a few more steps.

Click the cog at the top right of the screen.

![Click the cog](/assets/outlook-calendar/09.png "Click the cog")

Go to “Options”.

![Click Options](/assets/outlook-calendar/10.png "Click Options")

Go to “Calendar publishing” in “Shared calendars”.

![Calendar publishing](/assets/outlook-calendar/11.png "Calendar publishing")

Select your calendar from the dropdown list.

![Select calendar to share](/assets/outlook-calendar/12.png "Select calendar to share")

Right click the “ICS” link and click on “Copy link address”. Email this
link to <mailto:support@placecal.org>.

Thats it! We’ll get your events live as soon as we can.
