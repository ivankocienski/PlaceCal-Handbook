# Writing good event descriptions

## Think about who you are trying to reach and what you are offering

## Writing a good summary \(event title\)

Consider renaming your event with something more expressive and or less ambiguous if appropriate. For example, is it an "Exercise Group" or an "Over 50s morning workout"?

Equally, consider simplifying the name if it makes what it is clearer. "Manchester Community Qigong \(Women only sessions\)" is clearer as "Qigong for Women", for example. You can use the event description to elaborate.

It's better to spell out acronyms. For example, instead of "N.A." write "Narcotics Anonymous" . It's OK if the acronym is explained, for example "PARS: Exercise group for women". If in doubt, spell it out!

Avoid forward slashes and try and only use colons, commas, and ampersands as punctuation. "Coffee Morning/Food Voucher Service" -&gt; "Coffee Morning & Food Voucher Service".

A few last Zions. PARS: Exercise group for women \(Zion\) -&gt; PARS: Exercise group for women,  - Zion, etc.

Make sure if things are on more than once the naming is consistent so we can group them e.g. Coffee Morning \(Food Voucher Service\) -&gt; Coffee Morning & Food Voucher Service in all places, Mind / MIND, etc.
