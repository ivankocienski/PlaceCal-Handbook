Creating a new calendar
-----------------------

Firstly, let’s create a new calendar for all your Public events. This
makes it really clear which events are going through to PlaceCal.

Click “Add calendar” then “Secondary calendar”.

This will bring in a little box in the left sidebar to type the name of
your calendar in. This is a little hidden!

   Add your calendar name

Now you can add events to your calendar. Click on “New” and then
“Calendar event”. Give your event a name.

If your event calendar covers multiple venues, add the venue. Be sure to
use the autocompete to set the location: having the name correctly here
helps PlaceCal make sure the event goes on the correct pages.

If your calendar is entirely for one venue, you can either skip this
step or use it to store a room number.

Add relevant information about how often this event is, if needed.

Make sure that the calendar is set to the new calendar you just created,
and not the default one in Outlook.

Consider turning off Reminders if you use Outlook a lot. If this is the
only thing you use it for it might not matter.

Add a Description and check everything looks OK. When you’re ready,
click “Save”.

Great! You’ve added your event and it should show up. Repeat this for
your other events.
