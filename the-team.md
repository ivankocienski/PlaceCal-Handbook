# The Team

PlaceCal is currently run by Geeks for Social Change, a social enterprise formed by Dr Kim Foale to create community-led technical and social interventions.

PlaceCal is developed by Geeks for Social Change and PHASE@MMU. It was initially funded by Smart City accelerator CityVerve, with additional support from Manchester City Council.

We're working towards co-operative status and the creation of a PlaceCal foundation: watch this space!
