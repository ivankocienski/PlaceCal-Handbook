# Key benefits of PlaceCal

PlaceCal has a number of benefits for commissioners.

## "Asset mapping"

Commissioners often have problems with asset mapping (who really knows what asset mapping is, anyway?) for their community. This means they're unable to clearly identify and communicate the strengths and resources already available in their domain. The information is there, but no one can find it.

PlaceCal was developed as a tool that enables a Commissioner's smaller community groups to publish their information online easily. It's the missing link between existing directories (like Facebook or EventBrite) and the people who need the information.

PlaceCal is not a directory in and of itself. Unlike other directory or listings services, which require top-down maintenance from a central team, it works alongside existing directories. PlaceCal aggregates information from separate, unrelated sources to improve information-sharing.

We produced a table to show how PlaceCal differs from other product-based solutions, as an asset-based approach.

| Product-based (deficit) Approach      | PlaceCal (asset) Approach                                |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Start with technological lacks        | Start with existing facilities, staff and skills         |
| Respond to problems                   | Identify opportunities and strengths                     |
| Provide services                      | Invest in training and support                           |
| Emphasise role of technology/software | Emphasise role of community knowledge                    |
| Focus on individuals                  | Focus on neighbourhoods                                  |
| See people and clients and consumers  | Enable people to be co-producers creating what they need |
| Treat people as passive and "done-to" | Help people decide what's important to them              |
| Fix people                            | Support people to do what they want                      |
| Implement products as the solution    | See people as the answer                                 |

Instead of adding more on to the mess of information we have already, PlaceCal links people to what's already available in an organised, efficient way.
