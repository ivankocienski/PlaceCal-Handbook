Key benefits of PlaceCal
========================

PlaceCal has a number of benefits for commissioners.

“Asset mapping”
---------------

Commissioners often have problems with asset mapping (who really knows
what asset mapping is, anyway?) for their community. This means they’re
unable to clearly identify and communicate the strengths and resources
already available in their domain. The information is there, but no one
can find it.

PlaceCal was developed as a tool that enables a Commissioner’s smaller
community groups to publish their information online easily. It’s the
missing link between existing directories (like Facebook or EventBrite)
and the people who need the information.

PlaceCal is not a directory in and of itself. Unlike other directory or
listings services, which require top-down maintenance from a central
team, it works alongside existing directories. PlaceCal aggregates
information from separate, unrelated sources to improve
information-sharing.

We produced a table to show how PlaceCal differs from other
product-based solutions, as an asset-based approach.

+---------------------------+------------------------------------------+

Instead of adding more on to the mess of information we have already,
PlaceCal links people to what’s already available in an organised,
efficient way.
