# Getting started for commissioners

Getting started with PlaceCal can be broken down into 7 steps.

1. **Initial assessment:** Complete an initial form to assess who in the community running events and groups might be interested in the partnership.
2. **Initial workshop:** Work with the PlaceCal team to conduct an initial workshop together inviting everyone who might want to get involved in the partnership.
3. **Create neighbourhood team:** Work with the PlaceCal team to agree on who is to become Secretaries (someone who manages PlaceCal in your area), and work with other organisations to set this up.
4. **Meet partners:** Arrange for your Secretaries to contact all potential Partners (community groups), and ask to meet up. [Fill out this form](/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_tSioQTu0DaRaWDRzpFY5C1GxmleZgsfBnc5gX4C9p8/edit) to get started.
5. **Conduct interviews:** We arrange for the Secretaries conduct the initial interviews with potential area Partners, and ask them to sign the onboarding form so we can get their information into one place.
6. **Create shared system:** Secretaries go on to work with each Partner to get all their current event and organisation information into the PlaceCal system (assisted by PlaceCal).
7. **Periodic updates:** Secretaries periodically check back with each Partner to keep the PlaceCal system up to date, and monitor the area as a whole for changes.

And that's it! Once all the positions have been filled, PlaceCal runs smoothly with up-to-date events listings always available for your community.
