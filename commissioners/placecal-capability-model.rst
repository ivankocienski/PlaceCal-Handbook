PlaceCal capability model
=========================

Our impact measurement framework is therefore based on the capability of
people in a neighbourhood to be able to find information, do their jobs
effectively, or one of a range of other skills. We have based it on the
“capability approach” promoted by the UN Human Development Programme
that aims to ensure work is undertaken in an inclusive and
outcome-focussed manner. This methodological approach formed the
foundation of MAFNs age friendly research, and draws on world-leading
research into place-based community development from our UK partners The
Wellcome Trust Centre for Cultures and Environments of Health.

Role: Citizen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Residents using PlaceCal. Typically over 50s who have
multiple risk factors for social isolation, and very little technical
skills. It’s important to note that the other core capabilities are
citizens as well: for example, most managers who run groups for over 50s
are also in this category.

**Example task:** I can find out what institutions, organisations and
groups there are in my area, and what they are doing.

Role: Prescriber
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** A range of roles such as GPs, library assistants,
neighbourhood workers and family members who want a list of high quality
and up to date events to refer people to. This is a key role for the
platform: many non-computer users will be using it with assistance.

**Example task:** I can find out everything there is to do in my area
this week in a reliable and consistent format.

Role: Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** People who manage community organisations on all scales
from large national institutions with local offers, to unincorporated
community groups running a coffee morning out their living room.

**Example task:** I can make sure that information about who we are and
what we are doing is published and promoted.

Role: Admin
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Organisational workers who add and update their
information on PlaceCal directly. They work with secretaries to create a
listing of their organisation on PlaceCal, and add their event feed to
the centralised daily events listings.

**Example task**: I can publish information about who we are and what we
are doing in various forms

Role: Secretary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** People working in an area to bring organisations and
people together. They could be local community workers, health workers,
or community organisers delivering PlaceCal on the ground. We discussed
this role in the “development process” section.

**Example task:** I can work with organisations to help them publish
their information and make sure the right people know about it.

Role: Commissioner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** People and institutions who fund the PlaceCal platform.
They can either be community groups looking for a tool to bring their
neighborhood together, or city or health authority managers looking to
help their staff work in a more networked way. We explored this role in
the “market potential” section.

**Example task:** I can enable my team to find out who the local experts
are in an area when using an asset-based approach.

Role: Developer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** People working on the PlaceCal platform, adapting it
for their own area or need, or working with PlaceCal’s API feeds.

**Example task:** I can access local information about places and events
programmatically to build my application.

Meaningfully addressing exclusion
---------------------------------

A place-based and community engaged process is essential to meaningfully
address exclusion for vulnerable and socially isolated individuals and
groups. By tackling social and digital inclusion through the training
and software combined, our process enables removing the specific
barriers in either domain by giving people the capabilities to do what
they need.
