# Co-creation: developing the PlaceCal prototype

PlaceCal has already been piloted successfully in Hulme and Moss Side so you know that it works and can scale.

## Funding from CityVerve

Working with Age Friendly Hulme and Moss Side, we secured innovation funding for a PlaceCal MVP from CityVerve, a Smart City accelerator program in Manchester. The two awards totalled £86,000. This funding enabled us to explore with a range of different stakeholders the issues surrounding information sharing and dissemination. This included older adults, community group managers, and local authority employees.

## Identifying a need

Our CityVerve PlaceCal fieldwork shows that there are many different incomplete, inaccurate and poorly produced information sources in a neighbourhood, from flyers and posters to bulk email chains and poorly maintained websites. Many small local organisations and venues are simply not at all able to publish information about their activities.

Due to a lack of IT training, infrastructure, and suitable tools for community groups, it is almost impossible to find out what’s going on if you’re not already socially connected. 50% of community organisations (VCSEs) don’t have a website at all, let alone an up-to-date one. 40% of working age people struggle with basic tasks like deleting emails. This is even worse for older people, with 4.2 million people in the UK aged 65+ never having used the internet.

## Budget-friendly

Under-resourced community organisations don’t have the budget or time to effectively commission and maintain websites, and are not supported to work locally with others. As a result, it’s extremely hard for single-approach interventions to become established and allow for fruitful collaboration across providers in a way that benefits older residents.

An NHS England survey found that 40% of GPs would “socially prescribe”, or send patients to these groups if they had access to this information, which they currently do not. Digital exclusion of people and organisations has led directly to social exclusion and made it very hard for organisations to cope with day-to-day information sharing needs.

## Field research

After four months’ fieldwork, gathering direct input from older people into the design, development and training requirements, PlaceCal emerged. Our specific ‘capability’ research approach enabled us to discover and respond to the complex capabilities, barriers and opportunities for the creation of organised, reliable community information between residents, community groups and institutional stakeholders.

In December 2017 we launched PlaceCal in our pilot area, Hulme and Moss Side, at a joint community event attended by hundreds of residents, schools and religious organisations.

## Side-stepping duplication

Many software tools needed to publish information online already exist. It quickly became clear from our research that these tools were not suitable for most small groups’ use, that there was a chronic lack of tech skills across the sector, and that there was a lack of access to joined-up information sharing services.

We realised PlaceCal’s success would hinge on finding a method by which the social development could work in unison with the technological.
