# Digital & spatial inclusion

PlaceCal is a digital inclusion tool that raises the level of technical capability in a neighbourhood. It's a tool to aid the creation and support of local resident-led partnerships, by empowering people with simple tools they can use to work together better.

Residents in local communities can't find out whatâ€™s going on if they're not already socially connected. This causes the socially isolated to become more entrenched.

Digital exclusion of people and organisations has led directly to social exclusion and made it very hard for organisations to cope with day-to-day information sharing needs.

40% of working age people struggle with basic tasks like deleting emails, which is even worse for older people. 4.2 million people in the UK aged 65+ have never used the internet.
