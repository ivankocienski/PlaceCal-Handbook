# Digital & spatial inclusion

Our primary intended audience for PlaceCal are communities of place. These are neighbourhood partnerships representing anything from a single tower block to a small town. These groups work because they have a ‘real world’ relationship of geographical proximity, typically up to around 6,000 people.

The core goal of PlaceCal is to create well connected neighbourhoods that work better for older people, reduce social isolation, and increase active citizenship. Measuring the success of our interventions is not a simple task and has required an approach that can consider the entirety of the relationships and information in an area.

PlaceCal is a digital inclusion tool that raises the level of technical capability in a neighbourhood. It's a tool to aid the creation and support of local resident-led partnerships, by empowering people with simple tools they can use to work together better.

Residents in local communities can't find out what’s going on if they're not already socially connected. This causes the socially isolated to become more entrenched.

Digital exclusion of people and organisations has led directly to social exclusion and made it very hard for organisations to cope with day-to-day information sharing needs.

40% of working age people struggle with basic tasks like deleting emails, which is even worse for older people. 4.2 million people in the UK aged 65+ have never used the internet. PlaceCal does not require its users to be able to use the internet as other individuals can socially prescribe to them.

However, PlaceCal is a resource that is created directly for older people, who actively use the website on a regular basis. It's user-friendly and accessible so users can get the most out of the platform.
