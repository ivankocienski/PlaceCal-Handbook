# Who is PlaceCal for?

PlaceCal is for anyone who wants to find something to do in their neighbourhood. It's primarily aimed at older people, but most of our events are suitable for all ages.

It's also aimed at anyone who has a relative, friend or acquaintance they want to help get out the house, and people who work in a public-facing role such as doctors or libraries. We've tried to make it as simple as possible to get information to people who need it.
