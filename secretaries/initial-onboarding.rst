Initial onboarding
==================

This page deals with how secretaries can best approach onboarding new
organisations to become part of the PlaceCal Partnership. Secretaries
nominate their own organisations, find them through referrals or through
research in the community.

For each new organisation you identify, you will need to:

1. Conduct initial research to determine suitability.
2. Decide who to meet (the potential PlaceCal Manager) and think of what
   to say.
3. Meet with your representative, introduce the person to PlaceCal, and
   help them decide if they want to join the Partnership.
4. Work with your representative to publish information about their
   organisation on PlaceCal.
5. Identify the key contacts who will manage and maintain the
   information (Admins).
6. Agree a schedule for adding event information, and optionally
   creating a news article.

--------------

Initial contact
---------------

Before meeting up with your potential Manager, it’s important to find
out as much as you can about the new organisation before you begin. This
will save time for everyone involved by ensuring that the group is
suitable and you’re meeting the right person.

A partial checklist of relevant information to research is:

-  Information about the group as a whole.
-  Website, Facebook and Twitter links.
-  What kinds of events they organise and places they manage. If any of
   these are currently published online.
-  Paper posters or flyers you might have been given.
-  Recent news stories.
-  An idea of who you’re meeting with and what their job involves.

Create a ticket in your chosen project management system (for example,
Trello) with all this information to later review with the group when
you meet.

When your preliminary research is complete, contact the group. Explain
the benefits of the PlaceCal project for both the neighbourhood and the
group itself so they are more motivated to meet with you.

First meeting
-------------

While it’s possible to do it in less time, we advise setting aside two
hours for initial meetings. In these meetings you will:

-  Introduce the PlaceCal initiative
-  Complete the paperwork and onboarding process, filling in relevant
   consent forms.
-  Review the group’s information based on your initial review and
   publish it on PlaceCal.
-  Identify who will be responsible for keeping the information
   up-to-date
-  If possible and time allows, set up a calendar feed. If not, schedule
   up a followup meeting. If the organisation already has a custom
   website, refer it to Geeks for Social Change.
-  Update your project management system as needed.

We will work with you to conduct the first few onboarding meetings to
help you through all these stages.
