Initial Workshop
================

This is the first step in engaging the local partnership with PlaceCal.
You will:

1. Introduce people to the project and give them an overview of the
   objectives.
2. Decide who is going to do the work, and make a plan for delivering
   it.
3. Work together to decide who will be in the initial cohort, and how
   best to contact them.
4. Agree on the training materials to be used to do deliver the project.
