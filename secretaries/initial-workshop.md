# Initial Workshop

This is the first step in engaging the local partnership with PlaceCal. You will:

 1. Introduce people to the project and give them an overview of the objectives.
 1. Decide who is going to do the work, and make a plan for delivering it.
 1. Work together to decide who the initial cohort will be, and how to contact them.
 1. Agree on the training materials to be used to do this.
