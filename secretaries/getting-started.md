# Getting Started

This page takes you from project conception to conducting the initial workshop. It looks at:

 1. Setting up a system to manage the project.
 2. Choosing who to contact initially and what to say.
 3. Creating an initial calendar to get the project started.

## Setting up your tools

Here are the steps you need to go through to get set up:

### Recording your contacts

1. Start your project in either a spreadsheet or use a copy of our Airtable reporting tool (we'll provide you with this), depending on which technology you'd prefer.
2. Make a list of all the key people and organisations you want to get on board.
3. Think about each person or org and what they might need from you when you get in contact.
3. Spend time before you begin thinking about how you will record meetings, engagements, followups, etc. --Â detailed notes are important.

### Set up your calendar

1. Using Google Calendar, create a Google Calendar for the area.
2. If you don't have a Google account then register one now -- you'll need it sooner or later and we find Google Calendar to be the best all-around software for the task.
3. Start with one master calendar where you publish everything on behalf of the organisations. You can get started more quickly since it will take a while for organisations to start publishing their own data.

### Choose your initial cohort

1. Make a plan of action concerning the main organisations in your neighbourhood.
2. Ask yourself who are the people you need to talk to? What are the main places you need to visit?
3. Start out with the easier targets and bigger organisations since having "social proof" will make it easier to later convince other people to join.
4. Add any events you discover along the way to your Google Calendar. This calendar can later  be printed or shared with other people and will become a useful resource.
