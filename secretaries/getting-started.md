# Getting Started

This page takes you from project conception to conducting the initial workshop. It looks at:

 1. Setting up a system to manage the project.
 2. Choosing who to contact initially and what to say.
 3. Creating an initial calendar to get the project started.

## 1. Setting up your tools

We advise starting with either a spreadsheet or a copy of our Airtable reporting tool, depending on what you're most comfortable with. Start by making a list of all the key people and organisations you want to get on board. Have a think about each one and what that organistion might need. Keeping detailed notes is extremely important, so spend a bit of time before you start thinking about how you will record meetings, engagements, followups, etc.

We suggest starting with one calendar you put everything on. It will take a while for organisations to start publishing their own data, so to get started get something up there yourself. Create a Google Calendar for the area. If you don't have a Google account then register one now -- you'll need it sooner or later and we find Google Calendar to be the best all-around software for the task.

## 2. Choosing your initial cohort

As a secretary, your first job is to make a plan of action. Who are the main organisations in your neighbourhood? Who are the people you need to talk to? What are the main places you need to visit? Start out with the easier options and bigger organisations -- it will make it easier to convince other people to join if you have some well-known organisations on board.

As you create this plan, start adding any events you might find to your Google Calendar. This can be printed or shared with other people and will become a very useful resource in it's own right.

## 3. Your first calendar [Coming soon]
