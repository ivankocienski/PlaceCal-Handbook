# Getting Started

This page takes you from project conception to conducting the initial workshop. It looks at:

 1. Setting up a system to manage the project.
 2. Choosing who to contact initially and what to say.
 3. Creating an initial calendar to get the project started.

## Setting up your tools

Here are the steps you need to go through to get set up:

### Recording your contacts

– Start your project in either a spreadsheet or use a copy of our Airtable reporting tool (we'll provide you with this), depending on which technology you'd prefer.
- Make a list of all the key people and organisations you want to get on board.
- Think about each person or org and what they might need from you when you get in contact.
- Spend time before you begin thinking about how you will record meetings, engagements, followups, etc. -- detailed notes are important.

### Set up your calendar

– Using Google Calendar, create a Google Calendar for the area.
– If you don't have a Google account then register one now -- you'll need it sooner or later and we find Google Calendar to be the best all-around software for the task.
– Start with one master calendar where you publish everything on behalf of the organisations. You can get started more quickly since it will take a while for organisations to start publishing their own data.

### Choose your initial cohort

– Make a plan of action concerning the main organisations in your neighbourhood.
– Ask yourself who are the people you need to talk to? What are the main places you need to visit?
– Start out with the easier targets and bigger organisations since having "social proof" will make it easier to later convince other people to join.
– Add any events you discover along the way to your Google Calendar. This calendar can later  be printed or shared with other people and will become a useful resource.
