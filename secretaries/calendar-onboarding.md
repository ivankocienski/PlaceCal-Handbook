 1. Decide on the best platform(s) for each organisation.
 1. Create iCal or event API feeds.
 1. Ensure event information is correct and high quality.

## Test the feed

Import the ICS feed into your Google Calendar

Look at event info and decide if it looks complete
If it’s not go and bug them about it until they do it
When the feed is done, update Calendar status in Airtable to “ready for signoff” and let Kim know
