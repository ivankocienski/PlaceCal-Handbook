# Administrator Guide

PlaceCal Administrators \(admin\) support the Managers. They are the people who update the events listings and other information directly. They might also be responsible for other tasks like running the reception desk or answering phone calls. It's possible to be a Manager and an Admin.

As an Admin, you're ultimately responsible for updating your organisation's listings in PlaceCal. The main way you will be doing this is through the calendar software you are already using. In the future, you'll be able to update general information about your organisation as well.

This guide walks you through some of the core concepts behind how PlaceCal works. You'll find  detailed advice on publishing events and learn new tips about getting the support you need.

## Update once, publish everywhere.

The core design principle of PlaceCal is to make it as simple as possible for you to get your events in front of the largest number of people.

Unlike other platforms such as Facebook or Eventbrite (which require you to use their own app), PlaceCal works directly using the software you already have in your organisation. This means it can take a little bit longer to get set up – but once you're rolling everything you update is imported automatically into PlaceCal.

Before getting started with any new software, think about how it might be easiest for you to keep events updated. Let us deal with the rest.

**If you already publish a complete and up-to-date events listing on your organisation's website, **then stop here and [send us an email](mailto:support@placecal.org). It's possible that you already have everything we need work with. We can instruct your IT person or team how to import the information directly from your website.**

If you already have a partial online calendar that has some – but not all – of your events, we can use that as a starting point. Maybe you use Facebook for all your big events, but don't include smaller the day-to-day events as it's too much hassle.

If you don't have any online calendar at all, then check out our guides on how to set one up using technology your organisation probably already has.

Here are a few examples of setting up a new calendar in practice.

### Example 1: Big Life Centres

Big Life Centres currently manages two health and wellbeing centres in Hulme. These are the Kath Locke Centre and the Zion Centre.

## The problem

Before becoming a PlaceCal partner, each venue already had a dedicated staff member who would create a printed events listing every month. However, neither hosted the information on their website. They weren't reaching as many people in the community as they would have liked.

## How PlaceCal helped

We came along with the aim of helping Big Life Centres to set up a brand new events calendar for both venues that we could import into the PlaceCal system.

First, we created a calendar for each venue using Microsoft Outlook. One calendar contained every Kath Locke centre event, and the second calendar had the Zion Centre events.

Since all the events for each centre were held on the same premises, we didn't necessarily have to use the Location field in Outlook. All we had to do was set the location in PlaceCal at the same time as we imported the events.

In the end, we decided to use the Outlook Location field to store each event's room number, because these were large buildings. Every event can now display an accurate location and room number with minimum effort from the Admins.

## The outcome

The Big Life Centres now have one combined events listing for every event in both centres, and they also maintain separate directories for each venue.

It's much easier for the Admins to list their events and, by ensuring a wide coverage, they are attracting more members of the community to their centres than ever.

### Example 2: Hulme Community Garden Centre

Hulme Community Garden Centre brings the local community together through gardening through providing free access to education and skills training.

## The problem

Hulme Community Garden Centre were using Facebook to list their big public events like gardening festivals and open days. This was working well, but it meant that people following them on Facebook were struggling to find the right information since it was hard for them to list their smaller events.

## How PlaceCal helped

They were already using Google's GSuite tools, and so we helped them create a second calendar using Google Calendar.  They shared this calendar with every staff member for their weekly events, which included regular groups like home education lessons, and groups for people with learning difficulties.

We imported both of these calendars into PlaceCal, along with the Facebook events. This approach means that they can still use Facebook to promote their big events, while publishing comprehensive listings on PlaceCal. A bonus is that they can list every event from both Facebook and Google Calendar together on PlaceCal.

## The outcome

Hulme Community are now attracting more people to their smaller events, and they haven't had to use anymore new software. It's easier for their staff to organise their groups and communicate the information to their attendees.

### Example 3: The Old Abbey Taphouse

The Old Abbey Taphouse use Facebook for all their events due to the great sharing features in Facebook, as they mostly host events for other people that already use Facebook. Facebook allows people to create events and then link them to their Facebook Page afterwards, so all the venue has to do is approve the events. PlaceCal reads directly from Facebook so no further configuration is needed.
