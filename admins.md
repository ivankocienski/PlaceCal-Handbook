# Administrator Guide

Administrators are the people who physically maintain their organisation's listings in PlaceCal. As an Administrator, you will be maintaining an online calendar, and very occasionally updating things like contact information in the PlaceCal site.

## Canonical information

The core concept is to maintain a canonical source of information for your organisation. In contrast to other platforms that require you to re-enter all your event information, PlaceCal works by helping you set up a single authoratitive events listing for your organisation.

This means that you should use whatever is the easiest solution for you. 

### Example 1: Big Life Centers

### Example 2: Hulme Community Garden Centre

### Example 3: The Old Abbey Taphouse
