# Administrator Guide

As an Administrator \(admin\), you are responsible for updating your organisation's listings in PlaceCal. The main way you will be doing this is through the calendar software you are already using. In the future, you'll be able to update general information about your organisation as well.

This guide will walk you through some of the core concepts about how PlaceCal works; give you detailed advice on publishing events; and provide some tips about how to get support.

## Update once; publish everywhere.

The core design principle of PlaceCal is to make it as simple as possible for you to get your events in front of the largest amount of people. Unlike other platforms like Facebook and Eventbrite that require updating directly through their app, PlaceCal works directly using software you already have. This means it can take a little bit longer to get setup, but once you are rolling everything you update imports directly into PlaceCal. Before starting with any software, have a bit of a think about how it's easiest for you to keep events updated and let us deal with the rest.

**If you already publish a complete and up to date events listing on your organisation's website, **then stop here and [send us an email](mailto:support@placecal.org). It's possible that you need to do no further work and we can work with your IT person or team to import the information directly off your website.**

If you already have a partial online calendar that has some but not all your events, then we can use that as a starting point. Maybe you use Facebook for all your big events, but don't have the day-to-day events on as it's too much hassle.

If you don't have any online calendar at all then check out our guides how to set one up using technology your organisation probably already has.

Here's a few examples of this in practice.

### Example 1: Big Life Centers

Big Life Centres manage two venues in Hulme: the Kath Locke Centre and the Zion Centre. These venues both have a staff member who creates a monthly printed listing, but did not have this information on the website.

As all their events are in two specific places, we created a calendar for each one in Outlook. One calendar has all the Kath Locke centre events, and the other has the Zion Centre events. As we know that all the events are in one building, there is no need to use the Location field in Outlook: we just set this in PlaceCal when we import the events.

As it happens, these are large buildings so we decided to use the Location field to store the event room number. After setting this up, this means that all events can now show location and room number with a minimum of effort. The Big Life centres now have one event listing for everything in both centers, as well as seperate ones for each venue.

### Example 2: Hulme Community Garden Centre

Hulme Community Garden Centre use Facebook to list their big public events like festivals and open days. This worked well but meant that people on Facebook were struggling to get the information, and was making it hard to list the smaller events.

They were already using GSuite, and so created a second calendar using Google Calendar that they then shared with all the staff for their weekly events with regular groups like home education lessons and groups for people with learning difficulties.

We import both these calendars into PlaceCal. This means that they still use Facebook to update their big events and get public pages for everything on PlaceCal, and list all their events from both calendars together on PlaceCal.

### Example 3: The Old Abbey Taphouse

The Old Abbey Taphouse use Facebook for all their events due to the great sharing features in Facebook, as they mostly host events for other people that already use Facebook. Facebook allows people to create events and then link them to their Facebook Page afterwards, so all the venue has to do is approve the events. PlaceCal reads directly from Facebook so no further configuration is needed.
