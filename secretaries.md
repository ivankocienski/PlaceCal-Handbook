# Secretary Guide

Secretaries are the human face of PlaceCal, who work with resident-led partnerships to support neighbourhood organisations publish their information. Secretaries can be thought of as "neighbourhood curators": working with local organisations and partnerships they decide which information goes on the PlaceCal neighbourhood websites they manage.

Secretaries manage the news and information for the PlaceCal neighbourhood, create and update Places, Partners and Calendars, and create user accounts for the relevant people in those organisations. They're available on the phone or by email for one-to-one local support.

The Secretary Guide has the following sections:

 1. [Getting Started](/secretaries/getting-started.md) looks at the tools you'll need to use and how to kick the whole project off.
 1. [Initial Workshop](/secretaries/initial-workshop.md) explores what to expect at your initial partnership meeting, and how to get the project off on the right foot.
 1. [Initial Onboarding](/secretaries/intiial-onboarding.md) takes you through each meeting with a group, and shows an example flow and what kinds of information you need to collect.
 1. [Calendar Onboarding](/secretaries/calendar-onboarding.md) demonstrates how to get groups' events onto PlaceCal.
 1. [Followups](/secretaries/followups.md) has suggestions for how to ensure information stays up-to-date and complete.

You'll also want to read the [Manager](/managers.md) and [Administrator](/administrator.md) guides in order to understand the materials you'll be teaching.

In flowchart form, these stages are represented as follows:
