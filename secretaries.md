Secretaries are the human face of PlaceCal. These people work with the
resident-led partnerships to support neighbourhood organisations to
publish their information. They can be anyone but they are usually
nominated by the commissioner who supports PlaceCal locally.

They can be thought of as “neighbourhood curators”: working with local
organisations and partnerships to decide what information needs be
listed on the PlaceCal neighbourhood websites they manage. They are
comfortable with using the commonplace technologies that PlaceCal runs
on – Google Calendar and Microsoft Excel for example.

Secretaries manage the news and information for the PlaceCal
neighbourhood. They create and update Places, Partners and Calendars,
and create user accounts for the relevant people in those organisations.
They’re available on the phone or by email for one-to-one local support.

The Secretary Guide has the following sections:

1. {doc}`/secretaries/getting-started` looks at the
   tools you’ll need to use and how to kick the whole project off.
2. {doc}`Initial Workshop </secretaries/initial-workshop>` explores what
   to expect at your initial partnership meeting, and how to get the
   project off on the right foot.
3. {doc}`Initial Onboarding </secretaries/initial-onboarding>` takes you
   through each meeting with a group, and shows an example flow and what
   kinds of information you need to collect.
4. {doc}`Calendar Onboarding </secretaries/calendar-onboarding>`
   demonstrates how to get groups’ events onto PlaceCal.
5. {doc}`Followups </secretaries/followups>` has suggestions for how to
   ensure information stays up-to-date and complete.

You’ll also want to read the {doc}`Manager </managers>` and
{doc}`Administrator </admins>` guides in order to understand the
materials you’ll be teaching.

In flowchart form, these stages are represented as follows:
