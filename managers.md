# Manager Guide

PlaceCal is a social and technological initiative to help you reach more people more easily. By becoming a PlaceCal partner, you make sure that local citizens, neighbourhood teams, and social prescribers like GPs and library assistants know everything you're doing. Your events will be published in one more more regional daily events listings, occasionally published in printed material on your behalf. We are also working to get local information onto local radio and newspapers, and even new digital bus stop signs!

This guide contains:

 1. [Benefits](managers/benefits.md): ways PlaceCal will help your organisation and who will use the information.
 1. [Joining](managers/how-do-i-join-placecal.md): getting your information and events online and what to expect.
 1. [Management](managers/management.md): what kind of skills you will need in your organisation and how to fit PlaceCal into your existing capacity.
 1. [Support & Maintenance](managers/support-and-maintanance.md): how we will work together to keep it up to date.

## How much work is it to use?

Once PlaceCal is set up, it's almost no effort to maintain. It's not another event platform like Facebook or Eventbrite, and works by simply reading your existing calendar software. If you maintain a paper diary, we will help you set up a digital one using software you probably already have.
