# How does PlaceCal work?

PlaceCal is a partnership of community organisations.

**Partners** are the organisations who work in an neighbourhood. They might be health providers, unincorporated community groups, housing associations, tenants' groups, or other groups with a social cause.

Partners have **Partner Managers**, who manage the day-to-day running of their organisation. They might be involved in the legal structure of the organisation, or not.

Partner Managers sometimes delegate the maintaining of events and information to their **Partner Admins**, who might do other tasks such as run a reception desk or answer phone calls. Sometimes they do it themselves \(and are both Managers and Admins\).

Partners can be custodians of one or more **Places**. Places are community landmarks that are open to the public. These Places are often the public face of a Partner, often being the physical building that the Partner inhabits. Sometimes, the Partner and the Place have the same name -- this can get confusing!

Places are where **Events** take place. Events are added to PlaceCal through **Calendars**. Calendars are powered by your existing event management software such as Google Calendar, Outlook 365, or Facebook. If you're a larger organisation this might be a bigger system like Artifax, Jadu, or Drupal, or a custom website just for you. Calendars create Events, which can be assigned to Places and Partners, allowing Citizens to look at all the events in one Place, or all the events organised by one Partner.

Partner Managers and Admins are supported by **Secretaries**: local community development workers who help Partners get all the information about their organisation and their Places on PlaceCal. Secretaries can create Places and Partners in PlaceCal, create user accounts, and are available on the phone to chat to for support.

Secretaries manage one or more **Turfs**: neighbourhood regions \(Hulme, Moston\) or interest groups \(Cycling, Age Friendly\). These Turfs are each visible on a different PlaceCal subdomain name like hulme.placecal.org or cycling.placecal.org. Citizens can then easily view all the events on one Turf: this is the key strength of PlaceCal.

**Comissioners** are the people who fund PlaceCal and want to use it to help people work together in their region. They commission one or more Turfs, by funding us to train a Secretary \(employed by you or us\), and funding our **PlaceCal Developers** to update and maintain the site.

Every Event, Place, Partner Admin, Partner Manager, Turf, Secretary and Comissioner is part of the PlaceCal platform. All of these things are available through the PlaceCal API, allowing **External Developers** to create their own Citizen experiences using all the information in the system. This means that you might commission PlaceCal to enable this information on your behalf, letting you get on with the look and feel of your site using your existing team.
