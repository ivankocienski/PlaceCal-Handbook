# How do I administer my calendar?

We will need a single point of contact for the calendar, but this doesn't mean you can't allow other people to edit it within your organisation. It's worth having a think about how you can save yourself time here, and get your organisation working better together.

Maybe you have various people running their own events in your space, or maybe you want people who run specific sessions to add, move, or alter events as things change. You can do this simply using the sharing options in your existing calendar solution.

While things will always get missed now and again, it's really important to make sure your events are up-to-date and have all the relevant information attached. It's nothing to be scared of, but be aware that whoever takes on this role needs to be on top of any possible changes.
