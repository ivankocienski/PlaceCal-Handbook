# What does PlaceCal do

We define PlaceCal as:

> A co-constituted combination of software and training that works together to support a neighbourhood-level community calendar aimed directly at neighbourhood groups and the institutions who want to work better with them.

It's made up of a number of different elements, which we'll go into now.

## The technical side of PlaceCal

The PlaceCal software is the technical stack and infrastructure of our core program. PlaceCal imports and connects information from neighbourhood institutions and organisations who have signed up to be part of our program. As long as partners input their data regularly, PlaceCal will import, aggregate and publish on to the [PlaceCal.org](placecal.org) website automatically.

PlaceCal brings together existing calendar tools and IT infrastructure – which are tools that organisations are already using to organise themselves. This process drastically reduces the current manual workload of keeping event information updated and reliable, as well as synced across multiple partners.

## What does PlaceCal look like?

At its most basic, PlaceCal is a shared community calendar. It's a community of people working together to share information about their events. This community looks like this:

![PlaceCal seven core roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geeksforsocialchange/PlaceCal-Handbook/master/assets/seven-core-placecal-roles.png)

These PlaceCal roles are clearly defined and each type of person uses our calendar in a different way:

* **Citizen** – someone living in a community who directly benefits from the PlaceCal events listing
* **Social prescriber** – someone who's job can be made easier by having access to the events listing
* **Partner Manager** – someone who otherwise struggles to share their events with the wider community
* **Partner Admin** – someone who is updating an internal events calendar with listings anyway
* **Secretary** – someone working in the community whose job is to "asset map" current events across organisations
* **Commissioner** – someone responsible for improving the health and social outcomes in their area
* **Developers** – someone interested in using the PlaceCal software or API for their own purpose

## PlaceCal training program

The PlaceCal training is an extensive education package we deliver for community groups, regional providers, and community organisations. Our training is aimed at the health and social care, housing and volunteer institutions who are already invested in gathering information about service and events in their area. Generally their aims are to connect the local community in order to improve health and wellbeing outcomes. Where previously they have lacked a way of creating, storing and sharing this information collaboratively, our training aims to give these workers tools to support this collaboration using existing resources.

These local workers and residents take on key roles, acting as ‘secretary’, one of our seven “core capabilities”. These capabilities are derived from our research and based on the UN capability model, and are discussed more fully later in the document. Secretaries are active curators who ensure that the community is in charge of its local information. This information is then trustworthy and can be used by local health and community organisations.
