# Why PlaceCal was founded

PlaceCal started as part of a research project at MMU into making cities more friendly for the over 50s and reduce social isolation. This research looks at communities, places, facilities and people in four areas of Greater Manchester.

One of the first things we found was that people thought there was nothing to do in their areas. We went out to see if this was true, and after talking to dozens of organisations and community members, we found there was a huge variety of activities to take part in.

It became clear to us that the problem is one of communication. Mainstream social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are aimed at a specific type of event: large, well promoted, one-off events, generally for younger people. We realised we needed a way for small organisations to promote the more day-to-day events for less socially mobile and older people -- it was here that the idea for PlaceCal was born.

We started PlaceCal to enable organisations of all sizes with social goals to be able to promote their events with the minimum possible fuss, using their existing technology. We also started it to improve community technology infrastructure over all, and create a solution where the social, technical, and training aspects are all intertwined. We hope PlaceCal becomes one of many apps that use this approach.
