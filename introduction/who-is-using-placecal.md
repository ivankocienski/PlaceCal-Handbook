# Who is using PlaceCal?

Here are some example of the types of people using PlaceCal in their role already.

## Alasdair, GP

Alasdair works at Moss Side Health Centre in Manchester, UK. He's an example of an end user for PlaceCal.

Alasdair is a GP who sees patients every day. These patients have problems with their breathing or exercise, or are simply lonely. He knows that some patients take more than 40 ambulances a year to hospital just so they get to see another human. This places an immense stress on the health services, and doesn't really fix the problem.

Alasdair wants to "socially prescribe" -- to be able to refer patients to a suitable local group where they can do exercise or get some support. However, it's very difficult for him to get information about what's on near where people live. Lots of health workers maintain spreadsheets or email out PDF documents periodically, but these aren't really joined up or easy to use, especially in the 7 minute average GP's appointment.

Now he has access to PlaceCal, Alasdair is able to  quickly get a daily listing of everything going on in an area, which he can keep up on one of his computer screens in his appointments. This means it only takes about 30 seconds for him to work with a patient to help them find one of the dozens of events on every day.

As a result, he's able to socially connect his patients, enable people to use less medication, and get people moving again who have struggled to find suitable exercise groups to go to.

## Patsy, Neighbourhood Health Worker

Patsy is an example of someone who helps others promote their events using PlaceCal.

Patsy is a Neighbourhood Health Worker who works for Buzz, Manchester's wellbeing service. Part of her job is "asset mapping" -- working with local community organisations and keeping a list of what's going on that she can send to people like Alasdair.

The existing tools she has all have their limitations: spreadsheets are hard to share with others, local council websites are hard to update and not really used.

By using PlaceCal, Patsy can train up organisations to input and update their own event information so she doesn't have to keep chasing people to find out what's on. This helps other organisation be digitally included and helps them reach more people, keeping everyone happy.

PlaceCal also helps Patsy coordinate her work with other people doing asset mapping, drastically reducing the amount of duplicate information held by different organisations.
