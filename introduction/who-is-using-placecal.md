# Who is using PlaceCal?

PlaceCal is used by many different people in the community, but there are some who particularly benefit from using the platform.

Here are two key examples of people benefiting from using PlaceCal in their role already.

## User 1: Alasdair, GP in Moss Side

Alasdair is a GP who sees patients every day. He works at Moss Side Health Centre and we would consider him an end user for PlaceCal.

### Alasdair's problem

Many of Alasdair's patients have problems with their breathing, aren't able to exercise, or are lonely.

The lonely patients are sometimes the most difficult to help. Some of them call for more than 40 ambulances a year to take them to hospital – just so that they can see another human being.

This type of behaviour places an immense strain on the health service, and sadly it doesn't really fix the problem.

There is a solution – but Alasdair is currently lacking the infrastructure for it.

### Social prescription

Alasdair wants to ["socially prescribe"](https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalised-health-and-care/social-prescribing/). This means he would refer people to services in their community instead of only offering medical solutions. The services he could refer them to might be a local group where they can do gentle exercise, or find some social support.

1 in 5 GPs currently socially prescribe and 40% would refer if they had more information about what's available. ([July 2017, GP Online Survey](https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalised-health-and-care/social-prescribing/))

It's currently very difficult for Alasdair to find out more information about what's happening in Moss Side. The issue is not a lack of events going on, but the fact that there's no centralised place where he can browse events. Many community groups don't even have a website.

Health workers currently have the job of maintaining sprawling spreadsheets or emailing out PDF documents periodically. Unfortunately, these documents have several drawbacks:

* They get out of date very quickly
* Many people are duplicating work or missing out key events
* They aren't easy to use in the 7 minute average GP's appointment

### How PlaceCal helps

PlaceCal is the perfect alternative to these cumbersome spreadsheets and PDFs. Now Alasdair has access to PlaceCal, he can  quickly pull up a daily listing of everything going on in an area. PlaceCal has hundreds of events listed at any one time.

The calendar can be displayed constantly on one of his computer screens during his appointments. This means it now only takes about 30 seconds for him to work with a patient to help them find one of the dozens of events that take place every day.

As a result, Alasdair can now:
* Socially connect his patients to local community events
* Enable people to find an alternative to taking more medication
* Get people moving again after they may have been sedentary for some time

## User 2: Patsy, Neighbourhood Health Worker in Manchester

Patsy is an example of someone who helps others promote their events using PlaceCal.

Patsy is a Neighbourhood Health Worker who works for Buzz, Manchester's wellbeing service. Part of her job is "asset mapping" -- working with local community organisations and keeping a list of what's going on that she can send to people like Alasdair.

The existing tools she has all have their limitations: spreadsheets are hard to share with others, local council websites are hard to update and not really used.

By using PlaceCal, Patsy can train up organisations to input and update their own event information so she doesn't have to keep chasing people to find out what's on. This helps other organisation be digitally included and helps them reach more people, keeping everyone happy.

PlaceCal also helps Patsy coordinate her work with other people doing asset mapping, drastically reducing the amount of duplicate information held by different organisations.
