# Who is using PlaceCal?

PlaceCal is used by many different people in the community, but some of them find parts of their jobs transformed by using the platform.

Here are two key examples of people who are now benefiting from using PlaceCal in their role already.

## User 1: Alasdair, GP in Moss Side

Alasdair is a GP at Moss Side Health Centre and he sees dozens of patients a day. We would consider him an end user of PlaceCal.

### Alasdair's problem

Many of Alasdair's patients have problems with their breathing, aren't able to exercise, or are lonely.

His lonely patients are sometimes the most difficult to help, and he's only got 7 minutes in which to do it. For example, some patients call for more than 40 ambulances a year to take them to hospital – just to get the opportunity to see another human being.

This type of behaviour places an immense strain on the health services, and sadly it doesn't really fix the problem.

Alasdair knew what the solution was – but he lacked the infrastructure for it.

### Social prescription

Alasdair wanted to ["socially prescribe"](https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalised-health-and-care/social-prescribing/). This means he would refer people to services in their community instead of only offering medical solutions. The services he could refer them to might be a local group where they can do gentle exercise, or find some social support.

1 in 5 GPs already socially prescribe, and 40% would refer if they had more information about what's available. ([July 2017, GP Online Survey](https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalised-health-and-care/social-prescribing/))

It's was previously very difficult for Alasdair to find out more information about what's happening in Moss Side. The issue wasn't a lack of events going on, but the fact that there was no centralised place where he could browse events. Many community groups don't even have a website.

Health workers have the job of maintaining sprawling spreadsheets or emailing out PDF documents periodically. Unfortunately, these documents have several drawbacks:

* They get out of date very quickly
* Many people are duplicating work or missing out key events
* They aren't easy to use in the 7 minute average GP's appointment

### How PlaceCal helps

PlaceCal is the perfect alternative to these cumbersome spreadsheets and PDFs. Now Alasdair has access to PlaceCal, he can  quickly pull up a listing of everything going on in Moss Side for the next few weeks. PlaceCal for Moss Side has hundreds of events listed at any one time.

The calendar can be displayed constantly on one of his computer screens during his appointments. This means it now only takes about 30 seconds for him to work with a patient to help them find one of the dozens of events that take place every day.

As a result, Alasdair can now:
* Socially connect his patients to local community events
* Enable people to find an alternative to taking more medication
* Get people moving again after they may have been sedentary for some time

## User 2: Patsy, Neighbourhood Health Worker in Manchester

Patsy is a Neighbourhood Health Worker working for Buzz, Manchester's Health & Wellbeing service. Her role is to work people in Manchester communities to improve their health and wellbeing. Patsy is an example of someone who helps others to promote their events using PlaceCal.

### Patsy's problem

Part of Patsy's job is ["asset mapping"](http://www.brighterfuturestogether.co.uk/brighter-futures-together-toolkit/map-assets-in-your-community/). This means working with local community organisations to find out what they have available, and keeping an up-to-date list of what's going on.

She sends these listings to people she works with in the health service – people like Alasdair, the GP we talked about in the previous section.

The existing tools Patsy had to work with all had their limitations. They were spreadsheets that weren't easy to keep current or share, and local council websites that were hard to update and not really used by anyone anyway.

### How PlaceCal helps

Now by using PlaceCal, Patsy can train up organisations to input and update their own event information. This creates a centralised information source maintained by the people who own the events. Patsy doesn't have the endless struggle of chasing people to find out what's on anymore.

Organisations in the community are more digitally included by having access to PlaceCal. They can reach more people for their events, so it keeps everyone happy.

PlaceCal also reduces administration overhead for the area. It helps Patsy to coordinate her work with other people doing asset mapping as well, drastically reducing the amount of duplicate information held by different organisations.
