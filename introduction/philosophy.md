# Philosophy

PlaceCal is a community events calendar designed to help people find out everything that's happening near them, all in one place.

## Founded on research

The PlaceCal pilot emerged as part of a large scale co-research project. It was responding to the need for older people, community organisations and institutional partners to work together more effectively.

The research established that many older residents could find nothing to do in their immediate area – even though there was lots to do.

This meant there was a strong need for trusted, up-to-date and comprehensive sources of community events and contact information.

## Event discovery

PlaceCal connects community residents and service providers with the small everyday events. These events are usually quite hard to discover, but can be lifesaving for socially isolated older people. They could be coffee mornings, sewing groups and computer classes.

Many GPs want to socially prescribe instead of prescribing drugs, but are currently struggling with a lack of quality information. Find out more about our [social prescribers](/introduction/who-is-using-placecal.md).

## Place-based

PlaceCal overcomes the usual limitations of similar programs which have typically been 'user-centered'.

We move on from these individualistic approaches to more effective ‘place-based’ ones. We do this by working in both social and technical spaces to join up people who would otherwise never find each other.

PlaceCal's vision is for information infrastructure to be controlled by communities – not for profit, but for the benefit of their residents. The PlaceCal Foundation will own the intellectual property, maintain the open source code base, and ensure it’s fair use for all.

## Delivering a program

What does PlaceCal look like in reality?

PlaceCal delivers a community development program that connects people and organisations with culture, health and social housing institutions in neighbourhood communities. It tackles social isolation and promotes wellbeing.

It does this by enabling community partnerships to create and share joined-up information about services and events in their area. The program is an innovative blend of community partnership building, education and IT infrastructure.

## Digital inclusion

By working in this way, we support organisations (who otherwise wouldn't have a website) to publish high quality and up-to-date information. This information is shared widely across their local area, increasing both their breadth and depth of reach.

All this requires very little additional effort from organisations – beyond the initial setup. The costs are minimal compared to every community organisation providing their own IT resources.

We directly engage with our target audience, older people, by easily providing legible, printed listings and enabling other accessible formats and translations.
