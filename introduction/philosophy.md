PlaceCal is a community events calendar designed to help people find out everything that's happening near them, all in one place.

PlaceCal connects community residents and service providers with the small everyday events that are hard to discover but can be lifesaving for socially isolated older people, such as coffee mornings, sewing groups and computer classes.

The PlaceCal pilot emerged as part of a large scale co-research project to respond to the need for older people, community organisations and institutional partners to work together more effectively. The research established that a lot of older residents could find nothing to do in their immediate area and the need for trusted, up-to-date and comprehensive sources of community events and contact information.

PlaceCal delivers a community development program that connects people and organisations with culture, health and social housing institutions in neighbourhood communities. It tackles social isolation and promotes wellbeing by enabling community partnerships to create and share joined-up information about services and events in their area. It is an innovative blend of community partnership building, education and IT infrastructure.

By working in this way we enable organisations who otherwise do not have a website to be supported to publish high quality and up-to-date information that’s shared widely across the area, increasing both their breadth and depth of reach with very little additional effort beyond initial setup. We ensure direct engagements with older people by easily providing legible, printed listings and enabling other accessible formats and translations.

Working in both social and technical spaces gives us the potential to move on from individualistic ‘user-centered’ approaches to ‘place-based’ ones. Information infrastructure is therefore controlled by communities, for their residents. The PlaceCal Foundation will own the intellectual property, maintain the open source code base, and ensure it’s fair use for all.
