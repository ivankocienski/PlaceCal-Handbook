# Philosophy

PlaceCal is a community events calendar designed to help people find out everything that's happening near them, all in one place.

## Founded on research

The PlaceCal pilot emerged as part of a large scale co-research project. It was responding to the need for older people, community organisations and institutional partners to work together more effectively.

This project was a collaboration between Dr Kim Foale (Geeks for Social Change), Prof. Stefan White (PHASE@MMU) and the Manchester Age Friendly Network.

**Phase one**

The research first established that many older residents could find nothing to do in their immediate area.

Using word-of-mouth and literature searches over the following months, we discovered dozens of events and activities on every day. The focus therefore became not the lack of events, but a lack of high quality, up-to-date, accessible and complete community data.

Initially we distributed this information manually using a Google Calendar but found this quickly became unmanageable. All events had to be added by the small and time-limited MAFN team, information given to us was incomplete, contradictory or out of date, and the user interface of Google Calendar itself wouldn’t allow for better filtering and sorting with high numbers of events.

**Phase two**

We realised we needed a dedicated service to publish and manage this information, which was dubbed PlaceCal. We started working with Kim Foale (Geeks for Social Change) who had previously worked on the initial development of Street Support Network, an information service for homelessness run by Viv Slack. Through this partnership we gained funding from CityVerve to create a pilot addressing the issues of social isolation and loneliness in one of the MAFN areas, Hulme and Moss Side.

## Event discovery

PlaceCal connects community residents and service providers with the small everyday events. These events are usually quite hard to discover, but can be lifesaving for socially isolated older people. They could be coffee mornings, sewing groups and computer classes.

Many GPs want to socially prescribe instead of prescribing drugs, but are currently struggling with a lack of quality information. Find out more about our [social prescribers](/introduction/who-is-using-placecal.md).

## Place-based

PlaceCal overcomes the usual limitations of similar programs which have typically been 'user-centered'.

We move on from these individualistic approaches to more effective ‘place-based’ ones. We do this by working in both social and technical spaces to join up people who would otherwise never find each other.

PlaceCal's vision is for information infrastructure to be controlled by communities – not for profit, but for the benefit of their residents. The PlaceCal Foundation will own the intellectual property, maintain the open source code base, and ensure it’s fair use for all.

## Delivering a program

What does PlaceCal look like in reality?

PlaceCal delivers a community development program that connects people and organisations with culture, health and social housing institutions in neighbourhood communities. It tackles social isolation and promotes wellbeing.

It does this by enabling community partnerships to create and share joined-up information about services and events in their area. The program is an innovative blend of community partnership building, education and IT infrastructure.

## Digital inclusion

By working in this way, we support organisations (who otherwise wouldn't have a website) to publish high quality and up-to-date information. This information is shared widely across their local area, increasing both their breadth and depth of reach.

All this requires very little additional effort from organisations – beyond the initial setup. The costs are minimal compared to every community organisation providing their own IT resources.

We directly engage with our target audience, older people, by easily providing legible, printed listings and enabling other accessible formats and translations.
