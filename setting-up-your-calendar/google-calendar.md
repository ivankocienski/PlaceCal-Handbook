# Google Calendar

1. If you're not already in it, go to "Calendar" in Google Apps (click the grid next to the alarm bell in the top right of Gmail)
1. Optionally: create a new calendar just for public events. To do this, click the arrow on the right of "My Calendars" in the left toolbar, and click "create new calendar"
1. Add your events, making sure they're on the correct calendar - make sure to use repeating event options if appropriate
1. Click the arrow on the right of the calendar name if you hover over it. Go to "share this calendar"
1. Click "make this calendar public" at the top, and make sure "see all event details" is selected
1. Click on "calendar details" in the top toolbar (you can also get here from hovering over the calendar and clicking on the arrow on the right)
1. Where it says "calendar address", click on the "ical" button.
1. Cut and paste the URL it brings up and send it to us. It will probably look something like one of these:

```
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/you%example.com/public/basic.ics

https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/example.com_pf9b1gnk9e763sksa65v0i78tk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
```

If you would like us to be able to administer your events too:

1. Go back to "share this calendar", for example by clicking the arrow on the right of the calendar name if you hover over it and going to "share this calendar"
1. Add support@placecal.org as an admin and make sure to click "make changes to events and manage sharing"
