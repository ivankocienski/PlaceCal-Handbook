# On Boarding

Placecal has a lot of moving parts to line up before it can be worked on locally by a developer.

Prerequisites

- ruby
- rbenv
  \- rbenv-ruby
  \- ruby-gemset (hopefully at some point)
- postgresql
  \+ dev libraries
- node.js
  (for rails webpacker to work)
  \+ yarn

Steps taken

install correct ruby for rbenv
clone repo
cd into dir
bundle
set up environment

> - pick a postgres user, host and password
> - put in an environment shell script

create a user in postgres and a database with correct permissions
source your environment
run npm install yarn
run yarn?
run rails db:migrate
run it again?
run rails db:seed (and other scripts for importing base data)
now run tests to check its okay

setting up admin
placecal employs some funky routing based on the URL domain
add `lvh.me` and `admin.lvh.me` to your hosts file
Now pop open a console and create a user
visit lvh.me:3000/sign_in and log in
you should be redirected to `admin.lvh.me` and see the admin dashboard
