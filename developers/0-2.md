# PlaceCal v0.2

## Overview

The goal for the the next round of development is to modularise PlaceCal, creating separate sites \(or sub-sites\) that target each set of capabilities.

The current site will be split into the following components:

* `placecal.org` becomes the hub for PlaceCal as a whole, aimed at potential partners, developers, etc. This then accepts all event data we can get our hands on.
* `admin.placecal.org` becomes a unified administration frontend for administrators and moderators.
* `hulme.placecal.org` will become aimed more directly at Hulme residents. \(We’ve yet to resolve the “Hulme, Moss Side and Rusholme” mouthful issue.\)

We can then start considering more subdomains for each of our Age Friendly Neighbourhoods and other curious regions, based on a subset of the PlaceCal.org database:

 * `moston.placecal.org`
 * `milesplatting.placecal.org`
 * `burnage.placecal.org` 
 * `mossley.placecal.org`

Finally, we are beginning to consider interest-based platforms as well:

 * `cycling.placecal.org` or cyclemcr.org \(for example\), showing cycle routes over a larger area  
 * `agefriendlyhulme.org` \(for example\), showing the Hulme data but restricted to age friendly data, with more information about the board and how to get involved.

As part of this work we will also consider the suggestions and feedback to date.  

## PlaceCal.org  

### Audience

Neighbourhood leaders, health commissioners, city councils, interest groups, local partnerships. Anyone looking to set up PlaceCal in their area or for their interest.  

### Objectives

 * Explain what PlaceCal is and how it works  
 * Find local PlaceCal instances for your area or interest  
 * Create a directory of partners, regions and places that are on the platform  
 * Find out about how to develop websites or apps with PlaceCal data \(inc API   docs\)  
 * Updates and news about the project as a whole  

### Work to be done

 * Update current promotion material \(website, slidedeck etc\) to be more generic \(i.e., not tied to Hulme\).  
 * Review website information architecture, probably removing the Events listings and replacing with a list of active PlaceCal instances \(currently just Hulme\).  
 * Provide clear link to admin resources  
 * Add a blog with project news and updates  
 * Create a report based on the first round of tech audits to inform and refine the above  
 * Begin a basic overview of developer documentation \(probably a placeholder for now\)

## Admin.PlaceCal.org  

### Audience

Regional admins \(secretaries\) and potential or current partner admins.   

### Objectives

 * Partners can add calendars and places  
 * Secretaries can add calendars, places and partners, and edit partners in their region   
 * Get help adding information to PlaceCal for partner admins \(docs\)  
 * Get help adding partners and calendars for secretaries \(docs\)  
 * Find out contact information for PlaceCal as a whole \(technical support\)  
 * Partners can find out what’s involved in PlaceCal as a whole  
 * Ensure compliance with new Data Protection rules, and create a clear onboarding process with identified people  
 * Give secretaries and partners automated updates about their event data to improve reliability and validity  

### Work to be done

 * Train a new calendar secretary  
 * Create training materials and documentation for partners  
 * Begin creation of training materials and documentation for secretaries  
 * Create secretary user interface  
 * Create partner user interface  
 * Create comprehensive onboarding process considering GDPR  
 * Support more APIs that came up in the Hulme research \(Jadu, Artifax, Tribal Calendar…\)  
 * Create notification system for admins

##Hulme.PlaceCal.org  

### Audience

Hulme residents, organisations, businesses, and partners.

Need to resolve what to call this -- probably three aliased sites to begin with \[hulme/moss-side/rusholme\] which all have the same data.  

### Objectives

 * Single, joined-up source of all events, places and partners in the area  
 * Information about Hulme as an area and how to get involved in the neighbourhood partnership  
 * Promotion of Hulme-based activities as a whole  
 * Review user feedback to date  

### Work to be done

 * Reconsider home page of Hulme site  
 * Resolve naming issues  
 * Address front end bugs and tweaks for Hulme site  
 * Complete onboarding all Hulme organisations as admins

## *.PlaceCal.org  

### Audience

Future region or interest-based groups - cycling, yoga, age-friendly, etc.  
Objectives

Consider the costs and tech commitment in setting subsites up  
Create one or more as a pilot  

### Work to be done

 * Make sure the subsites are well documented  
 * Create a report on the commitment involved
