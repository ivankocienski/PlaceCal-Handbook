## What is PlaceCal for Commissioners?

A Commissioner for PlaceCal is someone who funds PlaceCal and want to use it to help people work together in their region. They are often overseeing large statutory organisations, who are our main target audience.

For Commissioners, PlaceCal is not just a platform or a piece of software. It's a holistic social and technical toolkit designed to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data.

PlaceCal helps us to make smarter, more resilient and better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone. It's targeted especially people at risk of being left behind by the "digital divide".

By tackling digital inclusion with our specific approach, PlaceCal opens the door to healthier and happier communities -- using the existing resources at hand.

Together, we are working to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data to make better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone.



## Key benefits

### "Asset mapping"

Commissioners often have problems with asset mapping (who really knows what asset mapping is, anyway?) for their community. This means they're unable to clearly identify and communicate the strengths and resources already available in their domain. The information is there, but no one can find it.

PlaceCal was developed as a tool that enables a Commissioner's smaller community groups to publish their information online easily. It's the missing link between existing directories (like Facebook or EventBrite) and the people who need the information.

PlaceCal is not a directory in and of itself. Unlike other directory or listings services, which require top-down maintenance from a central team, it works alongside existing directories. PlaceCal aggregates information from separate, unrelated sources to improve information-sharing.

We produced a table to show how PlaceCal differs from other product-based solutions, as an asset-based approach.

| Product-based (deficit) Approach      | PlaceCal (asset) Approach                                |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Start with technological lacks        | Start with existing facilities, staff and skills         |
| Respond to problems                   | Identify opportunities and strengths                     |
| Provide services                      | Invest in training and support                           |
| Emphasise role of technology/software | Emphasise role of community knowledge                    |
| Focus on individuals                  | Focus on neighbourhoods                                  |
| See people and clients and consumers  | Enable people to be co-producers creating what they need |
| Treat people as passive and "done-to" | Help people decide what's important to them              |
| Fix people                            | Support people to do what they want                      |
| Implement products as the solution    | See people as the answer                                 |

Instead of adding more on to the mess of information we have already, PlaceCal links people to what's already available in an organised, efficient way.

### Digital & spatial inclusion

PlaceCal is a digital inclusion tool that raises the level of technical capability in a neighbourhood. It's a tool to aid the creation and support of local resident-led partnerships, by empowering people with simple tools they can use to work together better.
