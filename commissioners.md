PlaceCal is a holistic social and technical toolkit designed to to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data. This helps to make smarter, more resilient and better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone: especially people left behind by the "digital divide".

PlaceCal fulfulls many functions for large statutory organisations, who are our main target audience. It's an asset mapping tool that enables smaller community groups in their care to publish their information. It's a digital inclusion tool that raises the level of technical capability in a neighbourhood. It's a tool to aid the creation and support of local resident-led partnerships, by empowering people with simple tools they can use to work together better. 

PlaceCal is not like other directory or listings services, which require top-down maintanance from a central team. These services will always remain essential tools for large organisations.
