PlaceCal isn't just a platform or a piece of software -- it's a holistic social and technical toolkit designed to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data.

PlaceCal helps to make smarter, more resilient and better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone: especially people at risk of being left behind by the "digital divide".

By tackling digital inclusion with this specific approach, PlaceCal opens the door to healthier and happier communities -- using the existing resources at hand.

Together we are working to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data to make better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone.



## Key benefits

### "Asset mapping"

Who really knows what asset mapping is anyway?

PlaceCal fulfulls many functions for large statutory organisations, who are our main target audience. It's an asset mapping tool that enables smaller community groups in their care to publish their information.

Not a directory. Works alongside existing directories. PlaceCal is not like other directory or listings services, which require top-down maintanance from a central team. These services will always remain essential tools for large organisations.
