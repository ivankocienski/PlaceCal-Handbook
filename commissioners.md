## Key benefits

### "Asset mapping"

Who really knows what asset mapping is anyway?

PlaceCal fulfulls many functions for large statutory organisations, who are our main target audience. It's an asset mapping tool that enables smaller community groups in their care to publish their information. 

Not a directory. Works alongside existing directories. PlaceCal is not like other directory or listings services, which require top-down maintanance from a central team. These services will always remain essential tools for large organisations.
