# Commissioner Guide

Here's our full guide for commissioners who are using or interested in using PlaceCal.

## What is PlaceCal for Commissioners?

A Commissioner for PlaceCal is someone who funds PlaceCal and want to use it to help people work together in their region. They are often overseeing large statutory organisations, who are our main target audience.

For Commissioners, PlaceCal is not just a platform or a piece of software. It's a holistic social and technical toolkit designed to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data.

PlaceCal helps us to make smarter, more resilient and better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone. It's targeted especially people at risk of being left behind by the "digital divide".

By tackling digital inclusion with our specific approach, PlaceCal opens the door to healthier and happier communities -- using the existing resources at hand.

Together, we are working to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data to make better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone.
