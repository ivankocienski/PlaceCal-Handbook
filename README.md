# Welcome to PlaceCal

PlaceCal is a community events calendar where you can find out everything that's happening near you, all in one place.

It's designed to help people find out about the small local events that can be hard to discover: the coffee mornings, sewing groups, computer classes and gardening groups that might be just around the corner.

It is a websiteâ€¦

But it's also a conduit for event information that's turned into posters, flyers, brochures, and hopefully local TV and radio broadcasts.

PlaceCal recieves event data from many sources.

PlaceCal's importer adds additional information when needed, along with geolocation data and moderation fro a little polish.

All that information is then output across a range of media to reach the whole community.

## What PlaceCal Does

PlaceCal is building a partnership of local organisations, charities, social housing providers, government services, health providers, and residents.

Together we are working to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data to make better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone.

PlaceCal was designed by Geeks for Social Change and PHASE@MMU as a community intervention to reduce social isolation for older people, and is based on our world-leading research into Age Friendly Cities. We won funding from CityVerve \(Manchester City Council's technology accelerator\) to make a prototype in Hulme & Moss Side. We are currently seeking investors and partners to help roll PlaceCal out to other neighbourhoods.
