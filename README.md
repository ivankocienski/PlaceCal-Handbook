# What is PlaceCal?

PlaceCal is a partnership of community organisations, charities, social housing providers, government services, health providers, and citizens working together to reduce social isolation and encourage active citizenship

It's a holistic social and technical toolkit designed to to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data. This helps to make smarter, more resilient and better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone: especially people left behind by the "digital divide".

PlaceCal enables simple and effective community information sources. The primary benefit is a hyperlocal crowdsourced live daily calendar for each neighbourhood. By creating one big listing together, it makes it easy for everyone to find out at a glance what's going on in an area: for everyone from older people to social prescribers like doctors and library assitants. It also creates a clear directory of who is active in each area, kept up to date by local experts.

It's especially aimed at helping people publish and find out about small, local, regular events that can be hard to discover. These events might be coffee mornings, sewing groups, computer classes or gardening groups: and are often run by organisations that have little or no budget or staff time for promotion. 

## Digital and Spatial Inclusion

Capability. Education and digital inclusion is at the core of everything we do. PlaceCal works by training and supporting organisations to publish their information, creating and supporting local resident-led partnerships, and providing the PlaceCal platform to manage it all.

This holistic approach to community asset mapping creates a low social capital social network for real world interaction: a radically decentralised, transparent initative managed directly by it's citizens. PlaceCal provides free and open source tools, training, expertiese and support that enables communities to own and manage their own information.

Spatial and digital inclusion - scotch egg model

Having all this information in one place means that it's the perfect information source for social prescribers like doctors, nurses, library assitants, and social care workers to find good things to do for their patients.

## Curated by humans

Each neighbourhood or interest group has it's own Secretary, who is the human face of PlaceCal. Secretaries are the "curators" of PlaceCal, working with organisations to promote events in the area as a whole.

## How we gather information

PlaceCal works with your existing technology, helping you set something up if needed. This means that it hooks into your existing event management software, updating itself automatically when you're set up.

Most people use Google Calendar, Outlook 365, or Facebook. We can also work with your custom CMS or event API.

## What we do with the information

It is a websiteâ€¦and it's also a conduit for event information that's turned into posters, flyers, brochures, and hopefully local TV and radio broadcasts.

All that information is then output across a range of media to reach the whole community.

Bus stops, TVs
