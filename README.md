# Welcome to PlaceCal

PlaceCal is an local community events calendar. It's designed to get community organisations working together to create a centralised events database.

It works by building on your existing technical capability -- our goal is to create less work for organisations in promoting their events, while making a great resource for citizens and the city as a whole.

PlaceCal is much more than just a website though. We're also going to automate production of brochures of local events, flyers and posters for your events, and enable others to create their own innovative applications. We hope that it will transform the way organisations think about their event data, and help everyone work together.

PlaceCal is being developed by Geeks for Social Change and Manchester Metropolitan University, in conjunction with Manchester City Council. It's funded by CityVerve, Manchester's Internet of Things demonstrator.
