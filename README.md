# Welcome to PlaceCal

PlaceCal is a partnership of community organisations, charities, social housing providers, government services, health providers, and citizens.

We're working together to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data to make smarter and better connected neighbourhoods that work for everyone.

Together, we've created a community events calendar that helps people find out everything that's happening near them, all in one place. By enabling all the places and organisations operating in a neighbourhood to publish this information together, we've created a low social capital social network powered by it's users.

It's designed to help people find out about the small local events that can be hard to discover: the coffee mornings, sewing groups, computer classes and gardening groups that might be just around the corner.

## What it is

It is a website…

![It's a website](https://placecal.org/assets/presentation/desktop/std-1-dcc7cd4e963ecf86e80f22914c4cd693bcc0da25128e4d6187a1c6683c94f233.png)

… and it's also a conduit for event information that's turned into posters, flyers, brochures, and hopefully local TV and radio broadcasts.

Having all this information in one place means that it's the perfect information source for social prescribers like doctors, nurses, library assitants, and social care workers to find good things to do for their patients.

## How it works  


![Inputs](https://placecal.org/assets/presentation/desktop/std-3-93fd59dcc08ac168782e877e563690a135880835d95084ea5d000ba7c241db46.png)

PlaceCal recieves event data from many sources.

PlaceCal's importer adds additional information when needed, along with geolocation data and moderation fro a little polish.

![Outputs](https://placecal.org/assets/presentation/desktop/std-5-cd71732e783aca053de069b45effd76626f654d5a916b01350e80ea11b784e37.png)

All that information is then output across a range of media to reach the whole community.


## WHAT WE'RE DOING

PlaceCal was designed by Geeks for Social Change and PHASE@MMU as a community intervention to reduce social isolation for older people, and is based on our world-leading research into Age Friendly Cities. We won funding from CityVerve \(Manchester City Council's technology accelerator\) to make a prototype in Hulme & Moss Side. We are currently seeking investors and partners to help roll PlaceCal out to other neighbourhoods.
