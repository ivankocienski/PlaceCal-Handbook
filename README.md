# What is PlaceCal?

PlaceCal is a partnership of community organisations, charities, social housing providers, government services, health providers, and citizens. We're working together to create really great neighbourhood information to create healthy neighbourhood where everyone is included, encouraging community wellness and active citizenship.

It's a holistic social and technical toolkit designed to to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of community data. This helps to make smarter, more resilient and better connected neighbourhoods that work better for everyone: especially people who are currently digitally excluded.

PlaceCal enables the creation and dissemination of simple and effective community information sources. The primary benefit is a hyperlocal crowdsourced live daily calendar for each neighbourhood. By working together to create one big daily events listing, it makes it easy for everyone to find out at a glance what's going on in an area. This can then be used by everyone: from older people to social prescribers like doctors and library assitants. It's all maintained and kept up-to-date by local experts: people in your community that know the area.

We're especially keen on helping people find the small, local, regular events that can be hard to discover. These events might be coffee mornings, sewing groups, computer classes or gardening groups: and are often run by organisations that have little or no budget or staff time for promotion. 

## Our approach

Education and partnership working are at the core of everything we do. PlaceCal works by training and supporting organisations to publish their information, creating and supporting local resident-led partnerships to help people work together, and providing the PlaceCal platform to manage it all and respond to people's needs.

This holistic approach to community technology creates a low social capital social network for real world interaction: a radically decentralised, transparent initative managed directly by it's citizens. This creates both spatial and digital inclusion: fairer and more inclusive neighbourhoods both on and offline.

The PlaceCal source code is free and open source: all our development is public and transparent. All our training materials and expertiese are avilable under a Creative Commons license, allowing you to make your own versions for your needs. Our technical support enables communities to own and manage their own information. 

Having all this information in one place means that it's the perfect information source for social prescribers like doctors, nurses, library assitants, and social care workers to find good things to do for their patients.

## Curated by humans

Each neighbourhood or interest group has it's own Secretary, who is the human face of PlaceCal. Secretaries are the "curators" of PlaceCal, working with organisations to promote events in the area as a whole.

## How it works

PlaceCal works with your existing technology, helping you set something up if needed. This means that it hooks into your existing event management software, updating itself automatically when you're set up.

Most people use Google Calendar, Outlook 365, or Facebook. We can also work with your custom CMS or event API.

## What we do with the information

It is a websiteâ€¦and it's also a conduit for event information that's turned into posters, flyers, brochures, and hopefully local TV and radio broadcasts.

All that information is then output across a range of media to reach the whole community.

Bus stops, TVs

## Why did we start PlaceCal?

PlaceCal started as part of a research project at MMU into making cities more friendly for the over 50s and reduce social isolation. This research looks at communities, places, facilities and people in four areas of Greater Manchester.

One of the first things we found was that people thought there was nothing to do in their areas. We went out to see if this was true, and after talking to dozens of organisations and community members, we found there was a huge variety of activities to take part in.

It because clear to us that the problem is one of communication. Mainstream social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are aimed at a specific type of event: large, well promoted, one-off events, generally for younger people. We realised we needed a way for small organisations to promote the more day-to-day events for less socially mobile and older people -- it was here that the idea for PlaceCal was born.

We started PlaceCal to enable organisations of all size with social goals to be able to promote their events with the minimum possible fuss, using their existing technology. We also started it to improve community technology infrastructure over all, and create a solution where the social, technical, and training aspects are all intertwined. We hope PlaceCal becomes one of many apps that use this approach.
