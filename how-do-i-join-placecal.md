# How do I join PlaceCal?

Firstly, we'll come and have a conversation with you to talk about your capability and suitability for the program. This conversation generally takes less than an hour, and helps us understand your technical staff, facilities, training programs, needs, and service offers. It also helps us get to know you better and highlights any pitfalls you might have.

Our technology is designed to work with yours. We'll look at how you can integrate your events most easily with PlaceCal. Right now we support Outlook.com, Google Calendar, and Mac Calendar for publishing events. You can either share your existing event information with us, or create a new public events calendar if you've got concerns about privacy.

If you don't have any existing calendar system, or use pen and paper, we're more than happy to help you set something up. Get in touch for a chat.
